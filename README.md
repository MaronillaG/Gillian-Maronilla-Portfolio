# Features:
- Displays projects that I have built using HTML, CSS and some with Javascript.
- Includes animations for my name.
- Includes animation on scroll for each section.
- Includes a clickable dropdown navigation to each section in the page.
- Include a section that allows others to message me directly.

# Process:
1. Design Stage
I browsed the internet for styles and colour-schemes that I liked the look of for inspiration.
I used Freeform on mac to help me visualise what I wanted to create and to help flesh out how I wanted to position my elements. After trying out many different versions. I learned even a rough outline of the structure was enough to help organise my ideas and start building. My focus was on structure and was going to add the content later as I progressed with the build.

2. Build
My initial design was built using only HTML and CSS. I enjoyed styling in CSS and deployed without including interactive elements. 
3. Adding Interactivity
I had to learn about how to minupulate the DOM in JavaScript and found fCC's YT video on exactly that. I wanted to add interactivity to the navigation menu. This made me re-think my website design and inspired me to have a more minimal and clean look. So I re-designed the new layout for the hero section.

4. Adding Animation
I really wanted to add in an animation of some kind and decided to do so for my name. In the end I used CSS for the animation on start.
5. Adding Responsivity
I realised that after the animations and the interactive menu button that I needed to set the scaling for smaller devices. I used the chrome developer tools to preview what it would look like on different devices.

## Learnings
- Getting feedback at the early stages of building is just as important as feedback at the end. 
- Its better to build something in a short amount of time to a rough/good enough representation of ideal and then refine and change that. Rather than building until perfect then pushing.
